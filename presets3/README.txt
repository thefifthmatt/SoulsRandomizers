Welcome to the directory of presets.

This is an attempt to make many of the tools that have been helpful for developing the mod
accessible to players, for the purpose of making challenge runs, presets, and showcases. You
can start making your own preset by copying Template.txt (or a different one) and renaming the
file to whatever you want your preset to be called.

Every time you open the preset selection window, it scans the directory for all text files.
Every time you select a preset from the dropdown, it tries to load it, giving an error if it can't.

There are two main ways to change enemy randomization: setting up custom pools, and
individual enemy assignments. "Oops All" mode sets all pools to one specific enemy
or type of enemy. Pool assignment generally respects progression and randomization
options. Individual enemy assignment overrides pools, and will usually ignore progression
and randomization options. Many of these modifications will generally completely change
a seed from what it was before.

To select a specific enemy, use its unique id, or use a name describing it followed by its id.
Names you can use are listed below.
